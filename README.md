Machine Learning Models: Classification & Regression
Welcome to my repository of machine learning models where I explore a variety of classification and regression techniques applied to real-world datasets. This collection includes models built with popular libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

üìÅ Models Included:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees & Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Linear & Polynomial Regression
Neural Networks for Regression and Classification
üåü Features:
End-to-end code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
Use of real-world datasets for practical insights
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification models
Evaluation of regression models with RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ scores
Visualizations of model performance and data distributions
Whether you‚Äôre a beginner learning machine learning or an experienced data scientist, feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
